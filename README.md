RecieverUI
==========

This is a library that I developed to interact with a user interface of a generic Digital Satellite Reciever

The interface has a 4 Digits 7-Segment display, 7 switch buttons, 2 Leds and an IR reciever.

The goal is to be able to display on the 7-Segment display, read the buttons pressed, switch on/off the leds and detect the IR commands recieved via some random IR Remote Control

The picture of the interface is included in the repository.
